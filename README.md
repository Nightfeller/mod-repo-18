# Social Network API
## Description

This is a baseline API built for social network applications. It allows users of the back-end to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE the users and thoughts, including their respective array documents like friends and reactions. Although it's simple, it gets the job done.

## Installation

To start, use ``` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``` to open up the Integrated Terminal. If you can't find where the backtick symbol is on your keyboard, it's usually to the left of the *1* key and above the *Tab* key.

Inside the terminal, you should see that it is in Powershell. To change it to Git Bash, go to the plus icon and click on the arrow besides it. There click on the option, *Git Bash*, to change the terminal to the compatible CLI.

Next, type in the terminal `npm install` or `npm i` to install the correct packages and dependancies. If any problems come up, follow the terminal instructions and use `npm audit fix` and/or `npm audit fix --force` to solve the problem. The instructions might also tell you to use `npm fund`. However, that is not needed. You would also need [MongoDB Compass](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/install-mongodb-compass-on-windows/) and [Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install) to be running to make use of this API.

If you need an alternate MongoDB install for MacOS you can find one [here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-mongodb-compass-on-macos/)

## Usage

First, make sure you have MongoDB Compass and Insomia up and running for the programs to work. Afterwards, type in `npm run seed` or `npm run heroku-seed` to add data into the database. Then, run `npm run start` or `npm run dev` to start up the API.
